IR-LED is connected between PIN 3 (PWM) and GND.
This Arduino Software receives the pulse/space information from Serial Port and Controls the IR-LED.
Tested with Arduino UNO 

Send the pulse/space duration (in micro-sec) as decimal-coded Commas seperated array enclosed with square braces.
Comm Port Baud Rate : 9600 bps

Example, 
To Send a IR wave as, 
Pulse 4500(uSec), Space 4500 (usec), Pulse 600(usec) Space 800(usec)

Send the Following String over Serial Comm.Port

"[4500,4500,600,800]"

As soon as the Arduino receives the "]" character, it starts sending the pulse over IR.

To Verify what data received by Arduino, Issue "?" command over Serial.
